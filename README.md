### SHOUTING COACH :loudspeaker:

Excercising app. Created because other apps 
- didn't let me create a custom workout    
  so I can change that one impossible 'spine cracker cross crunches' with  something doable
- didn't blow up on HUGE SCREENS   
  so I could read it without glasses

### uses
these MIT licensed libraries:
- require.js
- buzz.js (<- the only sound lib I could find that plays in _every_ dmn browser)
- jquery (plan to get rid of that)

### licensed
[GPLv3](LICENSE)
