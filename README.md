### SHOUTING COACH :loudspeaker:

![screenshot](images/shoutingcoach.png)

Excercising app. Helps me work out. Created because other apps ...
- didn't let me create a **custom workout**    
  so I can change that one impossible 'spine cracker cross crunches' with something doable
- didn't blow up on **HUGE SCREENS**   
  so I can read it without glasses
- didn't have **BIG BUTTONS** and hard to miss keyboard short cuts    
  hitting tiny buttons when you're working out is hard
- didn't **talk** to me    
  When I'm doing push-ups I'm not watching the frikkin screen, yo.

### uses

- require.js

- jquery (plan to get rid of that)
